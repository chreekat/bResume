        <li>
            Multifunctional member of a team bringing educational robots to
            the browser. Haskell to Javascript, front-end to firmware.
            Startup lyfe.
        <li>
            Contributed significantly to the architecture, development, and
            deployment of Linkbot Labs, a Qt-and-Web platform for
            robot-centered math and science curricula.

    <ul>
        <li> Visited <a

            >20 countries</a>, half via bicycle.
        <li> Returned to Thomson Reuters (below) for a short contract in
            spring 2012. Researched and prototyped a number of tools with
            technologies new to the team such as Boost::Build. Relieved
            numerous small but substantial burdens to the understaffed team
            in a time of transition.
        <li> Learned Javascript, joined the Haskell community, and met and
            collaborated with open-source programmers while on the road.

        <!--<li> Drafted a sci-fi novel based loosely on my travels. Not
            that anyone cares, including myself. :D -->

    </div>
    <ul>
        <li> Researched and rewrote an aging but critical monthly sales
            tool that generates financial data. Over the course of a year,
            I studied the entire process, made the case for rewriting it,
            and did so. The new system allows a markedly shorter and more
            consistent QA experience, and generates an end product in days
            rather than weeks.
        <li> Untangled a cryptic equation-definition system inherited by
            our team. While immersed in foreign tools and languages, I
            explored how functionality in our existing system could be
            mirrored in the new one. Laid the groundwork for a future
            conversion project.
        <li> Contributed knowledge and expertise. A passion for tools,
            technologies, and documentation made me a recognized source of
            information on Vim, Perl, shell scripting, and Free Software
            solutions.

        <li> Contributed to all technological aspects of this early-stage
            startup, including Linux administration, developer
            collaboration, system automation, and web development.
        <li> Constantly learned new material to achieve company goals. E.g.
            with zero foreknowledge of PHP or SQL, I inherited—and
            completed—a stalled MySQL/PHP project that represented a node
            in the business plan's critical path.
